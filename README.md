PDF Extraction Project
Overview
This project provides a stand-alone Python script to extract text from PDF files. The script is designed to handle password-protected PDFs by prompting for the password, extracting their content into CSV files, and archiving the processed PDFs to keep the input folder clean. Logging is implemented throughout the process so that the user is kept informed of the script's progress.

Features
Extracts text from PDF files, including those that are encrypted.
Generates CSV files containing the extracted text. Each CSV file is named after the original PDF with _extracted appended.
Automatically moves processed PDFs to an archive folder.
Provides detailed logging to inform the user of each stage of the process.
Easily extendable and customisable for future requirements.

Prerequisites
Python: Version 3.6 or later is required.
Dependencies: The project uses the PyPDF2 package for PDF processing.
Setup Instructions
Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies. Here is how you can create and activate a virtual environment on a Windows computer:

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Navigate to Your Project Directory:

bash
Copy
cd C:\path\to\project-name
Create the Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv env
This command creates a folder named env in your project directory.

Activate the Virtual Environment:

Command Prompt:
bash
Copy
env\Scripts\activate
PowerShell:
bash
Copy
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Note: If you encounter a policy error in PowerShell, you may need to change the execution policy by running:
bash
Copy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
To Deactivate the Environment:

bash
Copy
deactivate
Installing Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active (or if you choose not to use one), install the necessary packages by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Your PDF Files:

Place the PDF files you wish to process into the input/ folder.
Ensure that the PDFs are appropriately named.
Run the Script:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:
bash
Copy
python extract_pdf.py
When prompted, enter the password for the PDF files.
Process Overview:

The script will process each PDF in the input/ folder.
Text is extracted from each page and saved into a CSV file within the output/ folder. The CSV file is named after the original PDF, with _extracted appended.
After processing, the original PDF is moved to the archive/ folder.
Detailed log messages are displayed in the terminal, indicating progress and any errors encountered.
Logging
The script utilises Python's built-in logging module to provide real-time feedback. Log messages include:

Informational messages: Indicating the start, progress, and completion of tasks.
Error messages: Alerting the user if any issues occur during decryption or text extraction.
The log output includes the timestamp, the severity level, and a descriptive message.
Troubleshooting
No PDFs Found:
Ensure that your PDF files are placed in the input/ folder.

Decryption Issues:
Verify that you are entering the correct password for the encrypted PDF files.

Module Not Found Errors:
Confirm that all dependencies have been installed by running the pip install command provided above.

Extending the Project
This project provides a basic framework for PDF text extraction. Future improvements could include:

Enhanced text extraction for PDFs with complex layouts.
Support for additional PDF formats or encrypted file types.
A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier user interaction.
Improved error handling and reporting features.
Licence
(Include licence information here if applicable. For example, you could specify that the project is licensed under the MIT Licence.)

Logging is implemented throughout the process so that the user is kept informed of the script's progress.

## Features
- Extracts text from PDF files, including those that are encrypted.
- Generates CSV files containing the extracted text. Each CSV file is named after the original PDF with `_extracted` appended.
- Automatically moves processed PDFs to an archive folder.
- Provides detailed logging to inform the user of each stage of the process.
- Easily extendable and customisable for future requirements.

## Prerequisites
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or later is required.
- **Dependencies:** The project uses the [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) package for PDF processing.

## Setup Instructions

### Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies. Here is how you can create and activate a virtual environment on a Windows computer:

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.**

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\path\to\project-name
Create the Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv env
This command creates a folder named env in your project directory.

Activate the Virtual Environment:

Command Prompt:
bash
Copy
env\Scripts\activate
PowerShell:
bash
Copy
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Note: If you encounter a policy error in PowerShell, you may need to change the execution policy by running:
bash
Copy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
To Deactivate the Environment:

bash
